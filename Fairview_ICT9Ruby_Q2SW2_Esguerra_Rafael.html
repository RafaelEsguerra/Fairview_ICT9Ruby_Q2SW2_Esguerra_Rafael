	<td>Russian Blue</td>
	<td style="text-align: justify-all;">Bright eyes and a thick, gorgeous blue-gray coat are two characteristics of Russian blues. These cats are kind, dependable, cautious creatures who enjoy routines. The Russian blue makes a wonderful family pet thanks to its loving disposition, independent nature, and minimal grooming needs. You'll gain a loving family member who is completely devoted to you if you have the patience to socialize this shy cat.</td>

	<td>Exotic Shorthair</td>
	<td style="text-align: justify-all;">Exotic shorthair cats are a medium-sized breed with beautiful round heads, eyes, and bodies. The majority will weigh between 10 and 12 pounds. Compared to their long-haired relatives, exotic shorthairs are a quiet, inquisitive breed that is slightly more active. When you own one of these cats, you won't need to convert your living room into a cat salon. Exotic shorthairs are known for their plush, dense coats even though they are Persian cats' close relatives. However, they share the same round heads and flat faces as Persians.</td>

	<td>Munchkin Cat</td>
	<td style="text-align: justify-all;">Munchkin cats are quick, vivacious, playful, and loving. With their distinctive appearance and devoted nature, they more than make up for their short legs. The Munchkin is rather short, as you might have guessed from her name. She is actually exceptional among dwarf cat breeds because, aside from their diminutive legs, this tiny feline actually complies with all the other dimensions of an adult cat. Because they're relatively new; in the early 2000s, The International Cat Association recognized them as a distinct breed.</td>
